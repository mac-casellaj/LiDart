\plt{This SRS template is based on {SmithAndLai2005, SmithEtAl2007}.  It
  will get you started.  You should not modify the section headings, without
  first discussing the change with the course instructor.  Modification means
  you are not following the template, which loses some of the advantage of a
  template, especially standardization.  Although the bits shown below do not
  include type information, you may need to add this information for your
  problem.  If you are unsure, please can ask the instructor.}

\plt{Feel free to change the appearance of the report by modifying the LaTeX
  commands.}

\plt{This template document assumes that a single program is being documented.
  If you are documenting a family of models, you should start with a commonality
  analysis.  A separate template is provided for this.  For program
  families you should look at \cite{Smith2006, SmithMcCutchanAndCarette2017}.
  Single family member programs are often programs based on a single physical
  model.  General purpose tools are usually documented as a family.  Families of
  physical models also come up.}

\plt{The SRS is not generally written, or read, sequentially.  The SRS is a
  reference document.  It is generally read in an ad hoc order, as the need
  arises.  For writing an SRS, and for reading one for the first time, the
  suggested order of sections is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal Statement
\item Instance Models
\item Requirements
\item Introduction
\item Specific System Description
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{Guiding principles for the SRS document:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not repeat the same information at the same abstraction level.  If
  information is repeated, the repetition should be at a different abstraction
  level.  For instance, there will be overlap between the scope section and the
  assumptions, but the scope section will not go into as much detail as the
  assumptions section.
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{The template description comments should be disabled before submitting this
  document for grading.}

\plt{You can borrow any wording from the text given in the template.  It is part
  of the template, and not considered an instance of academic integrity.  Of
  course, you need to cite the source of the template.}

\plt{When the documentation is done, it should be possible to trace back to the
  source of every piece of information.  Some information will come from
  external sources, like terminology.  Other information will be derived, like
  General Definitions.}

\plt{An SRS document should have the following qualities: unambiguous,
  consistent, complete, validatable, abstract and traceable.}

\plt{The overall goal of the SRS is that someone that meets the Characteristics
  of the Intended Reader (Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}) can learn,
  understand and verify the captured domain knowledge.  They should not have to
  trust the authors of the SRS on any statements.  They should be able to
  independently verify/derive every statement made.}

\section{Introduction}

\plt{The introduction section is written to introduce the problem.  It starts general and focuses on the problem domain. The general advice is to start with a paragraph or two that describes the problem, followed by a ``roadmap'' paragraph.  A roadmap orients the reader by telling them what sub-sections to expect in the Introduction section.}

Businesses and individuals are increasingly using 3D scanning technologies to collect 3D data for modeling and analysis. The 3D scanning market is rapidly growing, with a wide range of applications such as VR, rapid prototyping, reverse-engineering, and inspection technologies. Many current scanning technologies require that objects are brought to specialized scanning facilities, where fixed devices such as CMM machines and robotic arms are installed. Hand-held scanning devices are also available,  however these technologies are expensive and require human operation. The cost and domain specific knowledge required are barriers to many users. There are limited solutions available for portable, remotely operated, and inexpensive 3D scanning solutions.  A low cost, portable, and user-friendly 3D scanner would make this technology accessible to a wider audience.
\newline
\par
This document defines the scope of the \progname\ project, specifies the scanning system, and defines requirements. The purpose of the SRS is discussed in detail in Section~\ref{sec_purpose}.  Section~\ref{sec_Scope} describes key project deliverables, as well as exclusions that are outside the scope of work.
\subsection{Problem Description and Goals}

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
\label{sec_purpose}

\plt{This section summarizes the purpose of the SRS document.  It does not focus
  on the problem itself.  The problem is described in the ``Problem
  Description'' section (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}).  The purpose is for the document
  in the context of the project itself, not in the context of this course.
  Although the ``purpose'' of the document is to get a grade, you should not
  mention this.  Instead, ``fake it'' as if this is a real project.  The purpose
  section will be similar between projects.  The purpose of the document is the
  purpose of the SRS, including communication, planning for the design stage,
  etc.}
  
  The purpose of this document is to provide specifications and requirements for the \progname\ 3D scanning system. This document describes functional and non-functional requirements, undesired event handling, and start-up behavior. The behaviour of the system is modeled through system decomposition diagrams. The requirements defined in this document will direct design decisions and will be referenced throughout the design phase to ensure requirements are being met. The requirements will be a direct input to the verification and validation plan.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 
\label{sec_Scope}

\plt{Modelling the real world requires simplification.  The full complexity of
  the actual physics, chemistry, biology is too much for existing models, and
  for existing computational solution techniques.  Rather than say what is in
  the scope, it is usually easier to say what is not.  You can think of it as
  the scope is initially everything, and then it is constrained to create the
  actual scope.  For instance, the problem can be restricted to 2 dimensions, or
  it can ignore the effect of temperature (or pressure) on the material
  properties, etc.}  

\plt{The scope section is related to the assumptions section
  (Section~\ref{sec_assumpt}).  However, the scope and the assumptions are not
  at the same level of abstraction.  The scope is at a high level.  The focus is
  on the ``big picture'' assumptions.  The assumptions section lists, and
  describes, all of the assumptions.}

\progname\ aims to design and build a low cost 3D scanning robot, paired with a GUI that displays a model of the scanned data.
The robot is expected to operate indoors on flat surfaces in a controlled environment.
A robot that is capable of operating outdoors or on rough terrain is not in the scope of this project.
The GUI will allow the user to remotely drive the robot, initiate 3D scans, and download the final stitched 3D scan.
However, tools for analyzing and modifying 3D scans generated by the system will not be implemented.
Software considerations such as licensing, user authentication, security, and data storage are also not within the scope of this project.

\subsection{Stakeholders}

Stakeholders in the project include all parties that would benefit from low cost, easily accessable 3D scanning. Examples of groups that fit this criteria include small visual effects studios, independent mechanical designers, and manufacturing firms. 

\subsection{Organization of Document}

\plt{This section provides a roadmap of the SRS document.  It will help the
  reader orient themselves.  It will provide direction that will help them
  select which sections they want to read, and in what order.  This section will
  be similar between project.}
The rest of this document provides detailed specifications and requirements for the \progname\ 3D scanning system. The document is organized as follows:  
  
\noindent \begin{description}
\item Section~\ref{sec_GeneralDesc}: General System Description 
\newline
A general overview of the system is provided using a system context diagram. The interactions between the system, the environment,and its users are identified.

\item Section~\ref{sec_ac}: Appendix - Reflection 
\newline
This section provides descriptions of the skills and knowledge required by each group member.
\end{description}

\section{General System Description} 
\label{sec_GeneralDesc}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.  \plt{This text can likely be
  borrowed verbatim.}

\plt{The purpose of this section is to provide general information about the
  system so the specific requirements in the next section will be easier to
  understand. The general system description section is designed to be
  changeable independent of changes to the functional requirements documented in
  the specific system description. The general system description provides a
  context for a family of related models.  The general description can stay the
  same, while specific details are changed between family members.}

\subsection{System Context}

\plt{Your system context will include a figure that shows the abstract view of
  the software.  Often in a scientific context, the program can be viewed
  abstractly following the design pattern of Inputs $\rightarrow$ Calculations
  $\rightarrow$ Outputs.  The system context will therefore often follow this
  pattern.  The user provides inputs, the system does the calculations, and then
  provides the outputs to the user.  The figure should not show all of the
  inputs, just an abstract view of the main categories of inputs (like material
  properties, geometry, etc.).  Likewise, the outputs should be presented from
  an abstract point of view.  In some cases the diagram will show other external
  entities, besides the user.  For instance, when the software product is a
  library, the user will be another software program, not an actual end user.
  If there are system constraints that the software must work with external
  libraries, these libraries can also be shown on the System Context diagram.
  They should only be named with a specific library name if this is required by
  the system constraint.}
  
Figure~\ref{Fig_SystemContext} is a system context diagram of the \progname\ 3D scanning system.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figures/Context Diagram.pdf}
\caption{System Context Diagram}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\plt{For each of the entities in the system context diagram its responsibilities
  should be listed.  Whenever possible the system should check for data quality,
  but for some cases the user will need to assume that responsibility.  The list
  of responsibilites should be about the inputs and outputs only, and they
  should be abstract.  Details should not be presented here.  However, the
  information should not be so abstract as to just say ``inputs'' and
  ``outputs''.  A summarizing phrase can be used to characterize the inputs.
  For instance, saying ``material properties'' provides some information, but it
  stays away from the detail of listing every required properties.}

\begin{itemize}
\item User:
\begin{itemize}
\item The user remotely controls the robot by sending commands to the robot. It is the user's responsibility to instruct the robot to move and scan the desired object. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Environment:
\begin{itemize}
\item Information extracted from the surrounding environment is an input to the scanning system.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Object:
\begin{itemize}
\item The desired object that is being scanned is an input to the system.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item 3D Scan Tools:
\begin{itemize}
\item External 3D scan tools are able to import 3D scan files that are outputted by the \progname\ system. Further analysis and modification of 3D data can be carried out by third party applications.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \progname\ 3D Scanning System:
\begin{itemize}
\item The system will provide the robot operator with alerts about errors that occur during scanning operations.
\item The system is responsible for executing commands provided by the operator.
\item The GUI will respond to commands provided by the user.
\item The system outputs 3D scan files that are supported by third party 3D scan tools.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

\plt{This section summarizes the knowledge/skills expected of the user.
  Measuring usability, which is often a required non-function requirement,
  requires knowledge of a typical user.  As mentioned above, the user is a
  different role from the ``intended reader,'' as given in
  Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}.  As in Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}, the
  user characteristics should be specific an unambiguous.  For instance, ``The
  end user of \progname{} should have an understanding of undergraduate Level 1
  Calculus and Physics.''}
  
The \progname\ 3D scanning system does not require any domain specific knowledge. Individuals and business using the system are expected to have the following prior knowledge:   
  
\begin{itemize}
\item An understanding of how to install applications on personal computers
\item Basic computer skills, such as how to navigate through application menus
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constraints}

\plt{System constraints differ from other type of requirements because they
  limit the developers' options in the system design and they identify how the
  eventual system must fit into the world. This is the only place in the SRS
  where design decisions can be specified.  That is, the quality requirement for
  abstraction is relaxed here.  However, system constraints should only be
  included if they are truly required.}

The following constraints are imposed on the \progname\ system:
\noindent \begin{itemize}
\item[C\refstepcounter{constnum}\theconstnum] The total cost of the system must be less than \$750.
\item[C\refstepcounter{constnum}\theconstnum] The project must be completed by April 2022.
\end{itemize}

\section{Specific System Description} 
\label{sec_SpecificDesc}

The solution that LiDart proposes to the specified problem is a two wheeled
mobile robot that can be remotely driven to take 3D scans of its environment.
The robot will have all required sensors onboard, these sensors will include:

\begin{itemize}
\item One or more cameras
\item A LiDAR module capable of measuring the distance to objects in a given plane relative to the sensor's orientation and position
\item Two encoders capable of measuring wheel rotations, one for each of the two wheels
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions}

It is assumed that the environment that LiDart will operate within will have the following properties:

\noindent \begin{itemize}
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{Assumption1}:] Not exposed to the elements (eg. Rain)
\newline Rationale: The robot will not be weather proofed, as this increases cost and complexity. A weather proofed configuration could be designed at a later date by modifiying the current robot.

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{Assumption2}:] Floor should be flat and suitable for driving on with plastic wheels (dry, hard, not slippery. eg. tile, hardwood, concrete)
\newline Rationale: The robot's simple 2 wheeled drive train is not suited to all terrains. This drive train was chosen to minimize cost and complexity.

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{Assumption3}:] Will remain static while the robot is active
\newline Rationale: This ensures there are no artifacts in the final stitched 3D scan resulting from changes to the environment between individual 3D scans.

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{Assumption4}:] Prepopulated with landmarks
\newline Rationale: This choice was made to simplify the operation of the state estimation algorithm. This should reduce the need for the user to understand the inner workings of the state estimation process

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{Assumption5}:] No translucent or reflective objects
\newline Rationale: Translucent and reflective objects can result in poorly behaved LiDAR measurements, and may impact the final stitched 3D scan.

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{Assumption6}:] Is illuminated such that the onboard camera(s) can clearly view the surrounding
\newline Rationale: The robot relies on cameras for state estimation, as such it must operate in a sufficiently lit environment. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Behaviour Overview}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Figures/Behaviour Overview.pdf}
\caption{Behaviour Overview}
\label{Fig_BehaviourOverview} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Normal operation of the LiDart system will proceed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Robot is powered on
\item User connects to the robot via WiFi
\item User opens the GUI
\item User drives the robot to a desired location, the user can use the live video feed and LiDAR data preview to choose such a location
\item User initiates a scan
\item Steps 4 and 5 are repeated until the user has scanned all desired areas of the environment
\item User downloads the final stitched 3D scan    
\end{enumerate}

\ \\
\noindent There are several events that fall outside of normal operations, those include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cancelling a scan.} If the user has initiated a scan but then decides that the location is not ideal, the user can cancel the scan. This discards the information from that specific scan and allows the user to resume driving the robot.
\item \textbf{Robot not localized.} If the robot is not localized, it will not allow the user to initiate a scan. To be able to initiate a scan the user must first drive the robot to a location where the robot can localize itself.
\item \textbf{Emergency stopping.} If the robot begins misbehaving it can be powered off with an onboard emergency stop switch. This is required in the event that a hardware failure causes the robot to pose a safety risk or to stop responding to user commands.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functional Decomposition}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Figures/Functional Decomposition.pdf}
\caption{Functional Decomposition}
\label{Fig_FunctionalDecomposition} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{Fig_FunctionalDecomposition} shows the high level data flow throughout the LiDart system. 

\ \\
The system receives data from the user through the GUI alongside inputs from the various sensors onboard the robot (monitored variables). These inputs include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Initiate scan command
\item Cancel scan command
\item Drive command
\item LiDAR readings
\item Camera frames
\item Wheel encoder readings
\end{itemize}

\ \\
The system will use the listed inputs to produce or drive the following outputs (controlled variables):
\begin{itemize}
\item Final stitched 3D scan
\item Live LiDAR preview
\item Live video feed of the robot's environment
\item Wheel voltages
\item Robot status (eg. Fault occured, Ready to scan) 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Subsystem Descriptions}

\subsubsection{Landmark Extraction}
Given a frame from the onboard camera, the landmark extraction subsystem will find all landmarks in
the frame and extract information about them. This information will include an ID which can be used
to correlate subsequent detections of the same landmark. It will also contain some information about
the position, and possibly orientation, of the landmark relative to the camera. The exact form of this
information will vary based on the choice of landmark type. Two example landmark types are listed below. 

\ \\
\textbf{Colored Spheres}
\ \\
Uniquely colored spheres could be used as landmarks. They would be easy to detect in a frame, uniquely
identifiable based on their color, and would provide information about the direction of the landmark
relative to the camera. Given enough landmarks in view these directions could be used to estimate the
camera's pose. The size of the sphere could also be used to estimate distance from the camera to the landmark.
\newline\newline
Although colored spheres are a very simple example of a possible landmark, they have several drawbacks. One
drawback is that for them to remain unique, each sphere would need to be a distinct color from everything else
in the environment, this quickly becomes difficult and would quickly increase the rate of landmark misdetections.
\newline\newline
Another drawback is the sort of position data provided by using colored spheres, you only get direction and
distance, no information about orientation. This increases the number of landmarks required to be in view for
an accurate estimation of camera pose. 

\ \\
\textbf{AprilTags \cite{olson2011tags}}
\ \\
AprilTags are a 2D barcode system (similar in concept to QR codes) designed at the University of Michigan for
easy and robust pose estimation.
\newline\newline
Each AprilTag encodes a unique number which can be used to correlate subsequent detections. AprilTags are also
robust to misdetection, as their barcode encodes information such that errors can be detected and rejected. Finally,
AprilTags provide pose information for each landmark, which greatly reduces the number of landmarks required to be
in view for an accurate estimation of camera pose.

\subsubsection{Differential Drive Kinematics}
The differential drive kinematics subsystem will provide an estimate of the pose of the robot using readings from
the wheel encoders. This estimate will accumulate error over time due to being a purely feed-forward estimator, but
it can be used to suplement a more complex state estimator.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Figures/Differential Drive Kinematics.pdf}
\caption{Differential Drive Kinematics}
\label{Fig_DifferentialDriveKinematics} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The LiDart robot will use a 2 wheel differential drive system, the derivation for the kinematics of such a system is as follows.

\ \newline
\textbf{Constants}
\newline $r$ - Wheel radius
\newline $b$ - Distance between the centers of the wheels

\ \newline
\textbf{Variables}
\newline $\vec{V}$ - Velocity vector of the robot
\newline $\vec{V}_L$ - Velocity vector of the left wheel
\newline $\vec{V}_R$ - Velocity vector of the right wheel
\newline $\omega$ - Angular velocity of the robot 
\newline $V_x$ - X component of the robot velocity
\newline $V_y$ - Y component of the robot velocity
\newline $\omega_L$ - Angular velocity of the left wheel 
\newline $\omega_R$ - Angular velocity of the right wheel

\ \newline
\textbf{Rolling without slipping}
\newline $\vec{V}_L = r\omega_L\hat{y}$
\newline $\vec{V}_R = r\omega_R\hat{y}$

\ \newline
\textbf{Kinematics}
\newline $\vec{V}_L = \vec{V} + (\omega\hat{z}) \times \frac{-1}{2}b\hat{x}$
\newline $\vec{V}_L = \vec{V} - \frac{1}{2}b\omega\hat{y}$
\newline $r\omega_L\hat{y} = V_x\hat{x} + V_y\hat{y} - \frac{1}{2}b\omega\hat{y}$
\newline $\vec{V}_R = \vec{V} + (\omega\hat{z}) \times \frac{1}{2}b\hat{x}$
\newline $\vec{V}_R = \vec{V} + \frac{1}{2}b\omega\hat{y}$
\newline $r\omega_R\hat{y} = V_x\hat{x} + V_y\hat{y} + \frac{1}{2}b\omega\hat{y}$

\ \newline

\newline $r\omega_L = V_y - \frac{1}{2}b\omega$
\newline $r\omega_R = V_y + \frac{1}{2}b\omega$
\newline $V_x = 0$

\ \newline
\textbf{Result}
\newline $\omega_L = \frac{1}{r} (V_y - \frac{1}{2}b\omega)$
\newline $\omega_R = \frac{1}{r} (V_y + \frac{1}{2}b\omega)$

\subsubsection{Movement Controller}
The movement controller subsystem will receive commands that the user issues via the GUI and control the
drive train as necessary.
\newline\newline
While the robot is in scanning mode this subsystem will attempt to keep the robot stationary, and as such
will ignore any drive commands. While out of scanning mode this subsystem will control the drive train
according to any received drive commands.
\newline\newline
The movement controller will make use of a closed loop velocity controller to control the wheel speeds of
the drive train. In this system the velocity of the wheels will be the measured variables, and the voltage
given to the wheel motors will be the actuated/controlled variables. An example closed loop controller that
is suitable for this use case is a PID controller, the discrete time equation for which is as follows.

\ \newline
\textbf{Constants}
\newline $K_p$ - proportional gain
\newline $K_i$ - integral gain
\newline $K_d$ - derivative gain

\ \newline
\textbf{Variables}
\newline $e_n$ - error at time $n$
\newline $u_n$ - output of the controller at time $n$

\ \newline
\textbf{PID Controller}
\newline $u_n = K_p e_n + K_i \sum e_k + K_d (e_n - e_{n-1})$

\subsubsection{State Estimation}
The state estimation subsystem will receive data from the landmark extraction and differential drive kinematics
subsystems and use that data to estimate the pose of the robot alongside the poses of all the landmarks it has seen.
This state estimation can be done using various different algorithms, one example of such algorithm is the particle filter.

\subsubsection{Point Cloud Stitching}
The point cloud stitching subsystem will take the raw LiDAR readings along with the pose estimation from the state
estimation subsystem and use that information to add data to the current 3D scan.
\newline\newline
It will do this by first transforming the raw LiDAR readings into the reference frame of the environment, as the
raw readings will initially be in the LiDAR sensor's local reference frame. This will be done using the pose estimate
provided by the state estimation subsystem.
\newline\newline
It will then take these transformed points and stitch them into the current 3D scan. There are many algorithms for
point cloud stitching, two examples of such algorithms are Iterative Closest Point and Moving Least Squares.

\section{Requirements}
\label{sec_Requirements}

\plt{The requirements refine the goal statement.  They will make heavy use of
  references to the instance models.}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\newline Rationale: The states can be used by the robot operator to troubleshoot operational issues.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\plt{List your nonfunctional requirements.  You may consider using a fit criterion to make them verifiable.}
\plt{The goal is for the nonfunctional requirements to be unambiguous, abstract and verifiable.  This isn't easy to show succinctly, so a good strategy may be to give a ``high level'' view of the requirement, but allow for the details to be covered in the Verification and Validation document.}
\plt{An absolute requirement on a quality of the system is rarely needed.  For instance, an accuracy of 0.0101 \% is likely fine, even if the requirement is for 0.01 \% accuracy.  Therefore, the emphasis will often be more on describing now well the quality is achieved, through experimentation, and possibly theory, rather than meeting some bar that was defined a priori.}
\plt{You do not need an entry for correctness in your NFRs.  The purpose of the SRS is to record the requirements that need to be satisfied for correctness. Any statement of correctness would just be redundant. Rather than discuss correctness, you can characterize how far away from the correct (true) solution you are allowed to be.  This is discussed under accuracy.}

\subsubsection{Accuracy Requirements}
\plt{Characterize the accuracy by giving the context/use for the software.  Maybe something like, ``The accuracy of the computed solutions should meet the level needed for $<$engineering or scientific application$>$.  The level of accuracy achieved by \progname{} shall be described following the procedure given in Section~X of the Verification and Validation Plan.''  A link to the VnV plan would be a nice extra.}
    
\noindent \begin{itemize}
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum\label{NFR_Accuracy1}:] The accuracy of the scans shall be within SCAN\_TOL. This level of accuracy meets the needs of parties interested in low-cost, easily accessible 3D scanning.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance Requirements}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Usability Requirements}
\plt{Characterize the usability by giving the context/use for the software. You should likely reference the user characteristics section.  The level of usability achieved by the software shall be described following the procedure given in Section~X of the Verification and Validation Plan.  A link to the VnV plan would be a nice extra.}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability2}:] The robot shall weigh less than ROBOT\_MAX\_WEIGHT.
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability3}:] The robot shall be able to be stored within the dimensions ROBOT\_MAX\_DIM.
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability4}:] The GUI shall be easy to navigate. The number of levels of navigation shall not exceed MAX\_NUM\_LEVELS.
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability5}:] The font style and size shall be consistent throughout the GUI. Fonts must be sans-serif and have a minimum font size of MIN\_FONT\_SIZE.
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability6}:] The GUI shall be intuitive to use. Users must be able to execute desired tasks within EXECUTE\_TIME of accessing the user interface, for at least every 9/10 tasks.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Error-Handling Requirements}
\noindent \begin{itemize}
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Errors1}:] The system shall display informative messages that alert the user of errors that have occurred. The messages may provide suggested steps to resolve the error.
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Errors2}:] The system shall log error information. Error information should be specific and descriptive.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Maintainability Requirements}
\plt{The effort required to make any of the likely changes listed for \progname{} should be less than FRACTION of the original development time.  FRACTION is then a symbolic constant that can be defined at the end of the report.}

\newline Rationale: This will facilitate activities such as debugging and reprogramming the robot. 
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability3}:] Standard, off-the-shelf components shall be used where possible. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Portability Requirements}
\plt{This NFR is easier to write than the others.  The systems that \progname{} should run on should be listed here.  When possible the specific versions of the potential operating environments should be given.  To make the NFR verifiable a statement could be made that the tests from a given section of the VnV plan can be successfully run on all of the possible operating environments.}

\noindent \begin{itemize}
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability1}:] The GUI shall run on a Windows operating system.
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability2}:] The GUI must be able to run on a standard personal computer. For example, a system with an IntelCore i5 processor and 8 GB of RAM.

\section{Development Plan}
\label{sec_dp}

LiDart's development will be split into to main efforts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Software and Control Systems (referred to as SCS)
    \item Electrical and Mechanical (referred to as EM)
\end{itemize}

As these efforts can both make progress independently, the development plan for
LiDart is broken up into phases describing what each effort will be focused on.

\subsection{Phase 1 - Foundational Components}
\textbf{Date:} Oct 6, 2022 - Nov 13, 2022 (POC Demo)
\ \newline\newline
In this phase SCS will build initial versions of the landmark extraction and state
estimation subsystems. These initial versions will run on a computer, not the robot,
and be tested using images taken externally (eg. using a smart phone). SCS will also build
a GUI which can be used to remotely drive the robot.
\ \newline\newline
In this phase EM will design and build the robot chassis and drive train. 
\ \newline\newline
The output for this phase will be:
\begin{itemize}
\item A robot that can be driven remotely
\item Initial versions of the landmark extraction and state estimation subsystems
\item An initial version of the GUI
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 2 - Initial Prototype}
\textbf{Date:} Nov 14, 2022 - Dec 8, 2022
\ \newline\newline
In this phase SCS will build initial versions of the differential drive kinematics and
movement controller subsystems. SCS will also adapt the landmark extraction and state estimation
subsystems from the previous phase such that they run on the robot and pull data from
the onboard sensors.
\ \newline\newline
In this phase EM will design and build any mechanisms required by the camera and LiDAR module.
The camera, LiDAR module and any additional sensors will be mounted and wired. 
\ \newline\newline
The output for this phase will be:
\begin{itemize}
\item A robot with all required sensors mounted and wired
\item A software stack capable of estimating the state of the robot using onboard sensors
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 3 - Minimum Viable Product}
\textbf{Date:} Dec 26, 2022 - Feb 6, 2023 (Rev 0 Demo)
\ \newline\newline
In this phase SCS will build an initial version of the point cloud stitching subsystem. SCS
will also extend the GUI such that it satisfies the LiDart functional requirements. During this
phase the ability to perform and download 3D scans will be added to the GUI.
\ \newline\newline
In this phase EM will refine the mechanical and electrical design of the robot, adding additional
features that would be required for an MVP. Examples of such features may include charging circuitry,
additional safeties or additional sensors.
\ \newline\newline
The output for this phase will be:
\begin{itemize}
\item A robot with build quality matching that of a minimum viable product
\item A software stack capable of generating stitched 3D scans
\item A functionally complete version of the GUI
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 4 - Refinement}
\textbf{Date:} Feb 7, 2023 - Mar 20, 2023 (Final Demo)
\ \newline\newline
In this phase SCS and EM will continue to refine the project, taking into consideration the feedback from the Rev 0 presentation.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

	Throughout the LiDart project, the team will be collectively working on gaining knowledge as well as experience in order to get the project completed.  Ranging from programming to electrical to mechanical, each team member will be gaining a lot of knowledge in their respective domains depending on their responsibilities.

Jon and Kareem will need to understand how to get the proper communication between the robot and the machine for the LIDAR sensors.
Throughout this process of figuring out the parameters, Jon will be able to expand on his knowledge on communications between the LIDAR sensors and the connected machine by working through the available documenation online. However, Kareem will be handling the controls of the robot by working through trial and error scenarios on movement and navigation. Even though Kareem will be primarily working through trial and error, he will be using a lot of resources online to help learn how to properly figure out the routes of communication that are going to be used.
Kareem has picked working through trial and error as that will be the best approach to seeing how the different parameters will affect the robot and its controls. Reading through documentation would not be very effective when trying to get the right controls for the robot as it would be based on theoretical values which won't directly apply to the robot. Jon has picked reading through online documentation since he prefers gathering information from the original source and then applying his understandings. Through theory, values can be used as a starting point.

While the software is being configured, Neeraj will be working on making the chassis for the robot. Making the frame for LiDart will require a lot of knowledge based on weight distribution and stabilizing the different moving components. The robot will have a variety of parts such as the LIDAR sensors, belts, cameras, and motors.
A lot of theory could be applied to designing the robot, but there will be a lot of trial and error as well within the process. That is why Neeraj is opting for using an iterative method to figure out the best design for the robot. 

Lastly, the electrical components will be a very critical domain of the machine. Getting the correct electrical equipment depending on the needs of LiDart will require a lot of work with the rest of the team. This is due to how LiDart needs to be configured. The required components such as the motor will require input from Kareem, Jon and Neeraj. The motor will depend on the weight of the chassis (Neeraj) alongside how the motor will be controlled (Kareem and Jon).
The equipment picked will affect the mechanical design as the size of the parts will be very critical to the overall design of LiDart. Michaela will be exploring online documentation to find the correct equipment that best matches what is required for the robot. Michaela figured that by searching online for the proper equipment she will best prepared for the electrical design that needs to be done. This would also be the most effective strategy due to the limitation on the budget that has been given.
